# AnyScreen Tests of LIST Checkbox Column using Style and WingDings Font

I added AnyScreen using this post: https://clarionhub.com/t/anyscreen-adding-to-a-100-hand-coded-project/5397?u=carlbarnes

This was done for a discussion on ClarionHub: https://clarionhub.com/t/displaying-bool-values-in-a-browse-list-as-y/5668/20?u=carlbarnes

As of 11.1.13815 the AnyScreen HMTL 5 client did NOT show Wingdings styles correctly. The Windows Client did show. Screen captures in the above ClarionHub topic.
